The discussion forum consists of the week's Module Activity, which is released at the beginning of the module. You must complete/attempt the activity before you can post about the activity and anything that relates to the topic. \n\n## Grading of the Discussion\n\n### 1. Initial Post:\nCreate your thread by **Day 5 (Saturday night at midnight, PST).**\n\n### 2. Responses:\nRespond to at least two other posts by **Day 7 (Monday night at midnight, PST).**\n\n---\n\n## Grading Criteria:\n\nYour participation will be graded as follows:\n\n### Full Credit (100 points):\n- Submit your initial post by **Day 5.**\n- Respond to at least two other posts by **Day 7.**\n\n### Half Credit (50 points):\n- If your initial post is late but you respond to two other posts.\n- If your initial post is on time but you fail to respond to at least two other posts.\n\n### No Credit (0 points):\n- If both your initial post and responses are late.\n- If you fail to submit an initial post and do not respond to any others.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n- **Late Initial Posts:** Late posts will automatically receive half credit if two responses are completed on time.\n- **Substance Matters:** Responses must be thoughtful and constructive. Comments like “Great post!” or “I agree!” without further explanation will not earn credit.\n- **Balance Participation:** Aim to engage with threads that have fewer or no responses to ensure a balanced discussion.\n\n---\n\n## Avoid:\n- A number of posts within a very short time-frame, especially immediately prior to the posting deadline.\n- Posts that complement another post, and then consist of a summary of that.\n",

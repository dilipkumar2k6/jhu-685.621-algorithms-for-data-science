    "# Weekly Discussion Forum Participation\n",

    "Each week, you are required to participate in the module’s discussion forum. The discussion forum consists of the week's Module Activity, which is released at the beginning of the module. You must complete/attempt the activity before you can post about the activity and anything that relates to the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading of the Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initial Post:\n",
    "Create your thread by **Day 5 (Saturday night at midnight, PST).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Responses:\n",
    "Respond to at least two other posts by **Day 7 (Monday night at midnight, PST).**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your participation will be graded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Credit (100 points):\n",
    "- Submit your initial post by **Day 5.**\n",
    "- Respond to at least two other posts by **Day 7.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Half Credit (50 points):\n",
    "- If your initial post is late but you respond to two other posts.\n",
    "- If your initial post is on time but you fail to respond to at least two other posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Credit (0 points):\n",
    "- If both your initial post and responses are late.\n",
    "- If you fail to submit an initial post and do not respond to any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Late Initial Posts:** Late posts will automatically receive half credit if two responses are completed on time.\n",
    "- **Substance Matters:** Responses must be thoughtful and constructive. Comments like “Great post!” or “I agree!” without further explanation will not earn credit.\n",
    "- **Balance Participation:** Aim to engage with threads that have fewer or no responses to ensure a balanced discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid:\n",
    "- A number of posts within a very short time-frame, especially immediately prior to the posting deadline.\n",
    "- Posts that complement another post, and then consist of a summary of that.\n"
